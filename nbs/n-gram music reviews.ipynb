    "**Motivating Question**: How 'hard' is language modeling without deep learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "My [goal](https://iconix.github.io/dl/2018/06/03/project-ideation) for the summer is to generate the best (most topical, structured, and specific) music reviews I can for new songs. How far can I push a non-deep language model towards this goal?\n",
    "\n",
    "_Language modeling_? an approach to generating text by estimating the probability distribution over sequences of linguistic units (characters, words, sentences).\n",
    "\n",
    "**A non-deep approach**: _unsmoothed maximum likelihood character-level language models_, or _n-gram language models_.\n",
    "\n",
    "[CharRNNs](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/), as popularized by Andrej Karpathy, are RNNs that learn to model the probability of the next character in a sequence, given the previous `n` characters. For more background, do check out the blog post if you haven't already!\n",
    "\n",
    "As Yoav Goldberg points out [in response](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/gist/yoavg/d76121dfde2618422139) to Karpathy's post, it turns out that you can model this probability with some degree of success _without_ neural networks, for example using _unsmoothed maximum likelihood character-level language models_. Let's see how they work and how well they do.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is an **Unsmoothed Maximum Likelihood Character-Level Language Model**?\n",
    "- _Maximum Likelihood (Estimation)/MLE_? deciding to model $P(c_i \\mid h_{i,n})$ by counting and dividing. First, count the number of times each possible letter $c^*$ appeared after the current history $h$; then divide this count by the total number of letters appearing after $h$. We divide as a way to _normalize_ the count.\n",
    "- _Unsmoothed_? deciding to treat any letters $c^*$ that never follow the current $h$ as impossible (probability 0).\n",
    "- _Character-Level Language Model_? our stated goal: predict a sequence, one character at a time!\n",
    "\n",
    "We model MLE as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(c_i \\mid h_{i,n})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $c_i$ is the next character in the sequence and $h_{i,n}$ is the _history_, or previous $n$ characters in the sequence preceding $c_i$ (i.e., $c_{i-(n-1)} ... c_{i-1}$). $n$ - the number of letters we need to guess based on - is also referred to as the _order_ of language model.\n",
    "\n",
    "What's nice about using MLE here is that this is the estimation that forms the basis for most _supervised machine learning_ - we are trying to predict $c_i$ given observations $h_{i,n}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "From now on, we'll call this model an **n-gram language model**, for short."
